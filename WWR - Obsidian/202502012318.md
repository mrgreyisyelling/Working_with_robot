create a script to target this file: /home/mike/Documents/Programming/Working_with_robot/Link to gtimelog/projects/projects.txt and break out every '#' level line into a file in /projects/ that is 'name of project'.txt, and place inside that file rows between that '#' level and the next '#' level Make sense?

Here's a Python script that will parse your `projects.txt` file and break each `#` level section into its own file in `/projects/`. Each file will be named based on the project title and contain the tasks listed under that section.

### Script:

```python
import os
import re

# File paths
input_file = "/home/mike/Documents/Programming/Working_with_robot/Link to gtimelog/projects/projects.txt"
output_dir = "/home/mike/Documents/Programming/Working_with_robot/Link to gtimelog/projects/"

# Ensure output directory exists
os.makedirs(output_dir, exist_ok=True)

# Read file content
with open(input_file, "r", encoding="utf-8") as f:
    lines = f.readlines()

# Process file content
current_project = None
project_content = []

for line in lines:
    match = re.match(r"^# (.+)", line)
    if match:
        # Write the previous project to a file
        if current_project and project_content:
            project_filename = os.path.join(output_dir, f"{current_project}.txt")
            with open(project_filename, "w", encoding="utf-8") as proj_file:
                proj_file.writelines(project_content)

        # Start new project
        current_project = match.group(1).strip().replace(" ", "_")  # Sanitize filename
        project_content = []
    elif current_project:
        project_content.append(line)

# Write the last project
if current_project and project_content:
    project_filename = os.path.join(output_dir, f"{current_project}.txt")
    with open(project_filename, "w", encoding="utf-8") as proj_file:
        proj_file.writelines(project_content)

print(f"Projects split into {output_dir}")
```

### What This Does:

- Reads `projects.txt`
- Identifies sections starting with `#`
- Writes each sectionâ€™s contents into a separate file named after the project
- Saves files inside `/projects/`
