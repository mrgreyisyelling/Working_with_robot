### **Building a Shared Tenant Screening Network**

If every landlord in the city **uses the same form**, we create a **shared dataset** of tenant applications. This lets us:

âœ… **Track Who Knows Who** â€“ Identify patterns in landlord references and co-applicants.  
âœ… **See Whoâ€™s Applying Where** â€“ Spot tenants who apply repeatedly or get denied often.  
âœ… **Detect Good Networks** â€“ Prioritize applicants with strong landlord connections.  
âœ… **Filter Out Problem Tenants** â€“ Avoid renters with a bad track record.

### **How This Works in Practice**

1. **Every application gets stored in a database** (Name, Contact Info, Landlord, Employer, etc.).
2. **We link applications together by shared landlords, addresses, or co-applicants.**
3. **A network graph is built** to visualize tenant connections & movement between properties.
4. **Landlords can see patterns** (e.g., who has stable history vs. who keeps moving & getting denied).

### **Key Data Points for Network Mapping**

|Field|Purpose|
|---|---|
|**Full Name**|Identifies repeat applicants|
|**Phone & Email**|Matches records over time|
|**Last Landlord & Contact**|Connects tenants to landlords & creates a reference network|
|**Last Address**|Tracks tenant movement & stability|
|**Employer & Income**|Checks job stability & affordability|
|**How Many Applications?**|Flags high-movement tenants|

### **Graph Example**

- If **John Doe** applied at 3 properties in 2 months and got denied twice â†’ ðŸš© Red Flag.
- If **Mary Smith** has a great history with a known good landlord â†’ âœ… Preferred.
- If **Kevin & Lisa** apply separately but always list the same last landlord â†’ ðŸ”— Linked as possible co-tenants.

### **Implementation**

1. **Store applications in a simple database (PostgreSQL / MongoDB / Firebase).**
2. **Run Graph Analysis (NetworkX, Neo4j, or Pandas) to map relationships.**
3. **Build a Web Dashboard for Landlords to View Connections & Flags.**
