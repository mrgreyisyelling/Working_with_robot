## 1. Manager’s Guiding Question & Step-by-Step Procedure

### **Guiding Question:**

**“Does the applicant meet all our established financial and risk criteria—namely, having the required upfront funds, stable income, and a risk profile (no pets, no children, clean financial and background history) that qualifies them for tenancy?”**

### **Step-by-Step Procedures:**

1. **Collect Application Materials:**
    
    - Request the completed rental application.
    - Collect supporting documents: proof of income (pay stubs, employment verification), bank statements, and any necessary identification.
2. **Verify Financial Requirements:**
    
    - **Upfront Payment Check:** Confirm that the applicant has access to the full move-in funds (Deposit + Last Month’s Rent = **$2,000**) in addition to the **First Month’s Rent** due on move-in.
    - **Escrow Setup:** Prepare to place the **$2,000 deposit** into an escrow account designated for covering potential court costs in the event of lease violations.
3. **Assess Tenant Risk Factors in Order of Priority:**
    
    - **a. Ability to Pay Upfront:** Ensure the tenant can cover the required funds.
    - **b. Stable Income & Job Security:** Verify current employment and income stability.
    - **c. Pet Policy Compliance:** Confirm that the applicant does not have pets (unless an exception is granted).
    - **d. Household Composition:** Ensure there are no children (if this is part of the criteria).
    - **e. Work History:** Evaluate the applicant’s employment history for consistency and reliability.
    - **f. Bank History:** Check for a clean record (no significant overdrafts or red flags).
    - **g. Background Check:** Run a comprehensive background check to rule out major legal issues or rental fraud.
    - **h. Credit & Judgment History:** Confirm there are no recent judgments or unpaid debts that might indicate future payment issues.
4. **Assign and Calculate Risk Scores:**
    
    - Use your pre-defined weighting system to score each risk factor.
    - Tally the scores to form an overall risk profile.
    - Compare the total risk score against your established threshold for tenant approval.
5. **Make the Approval Decision:**
    
    - **If the Risk Score is Acceptable:** Proceed with lease documentation and escrow account setup.
    - **If the Risk Score Exceeds the Threshold (High Risk):** Politely decline the application and provide any applicable feedback per company policy.
6. **Finalize Documentation and Communication:**
    
    - **For Approved Applicants:**
        - Draft the lease agreement with clear terms regarding the deposit, escrow, and rent due dates.
        - Inform the applicant of the next steps and schedule a move-in date.
    - **For Declined Applicants:**
        - Notify the applicant of the decision, providing a brief explanation based on the risk assessment criteria if appropriate.
7. **Record Keeping:**
    
    - Document all findings and risk scores.
    - Ensure that all financial transactions (especially the escrow deposit) are properly recorded and compliant with legal standards.
