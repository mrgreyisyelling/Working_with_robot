For a **short and effective** rental application form that **filters for quality tenants**, we want to collect just enough information to gauge reliability **without making it overwhelming**.

### **Best Questions for the Form:**

1. **Full Name**
2. **Phone Number & Email** (For contact & verification)
3. **Current Employer & Job Title** (Shows stability)
4. **Monthly Income** (Quick rent affordability check)
5. **Name & Contact of Last Landlord** (Direct reference check)
6. **Reason for Moving** (Red flags: evictions, disputes)
7. **Do you have any pets?** (If applicable)
8. **How many people will live in the unit?** (Avoid overcrowding)

### **Optional for Extra Screening (But Not Required Upfront):**

- **Last Address** (Can get this from landlord reference)
- **How long have you lived at your current place?**
- **Criminal History Disclosure?** (May scare away good applicants, better to ask landlords)

### **Why This Works?**

- **Short & Effective** â€“ Just the essentials to filter out problematic tenants.
- **Focuses on Connection & Stability** â€“ Landlord & job history give strong signals.
- **Easy Follow-Up** â€“ If they pass the first check, you can ask for more details later.
