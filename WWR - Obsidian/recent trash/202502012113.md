# 📌 Why Am I Selling the Real Estate?  

## 🔹 Core Issue  
I don’t **want** to sell the real estate, but I feel like I **have to.**  
The question is: **What is actually driving this decision?**  

## 🔹 Possible Motivations  
- **Guilt** → Am I selling because I feel obligated to?  
- **Capacity** → Do I truly lack the ability to maintain these properties?  
- **Strategy** → Is selling the best long-term move, or just the easiest?  
- **Vision** → If I keep them, what is the plan that makes it work?

## **🏠 Alternative Vision: A Structured Housing Network**  
I believe the best way to fill these houses is by **developing a strong, well-run social network** that **gates access strategically** to attract the right long-term tenants.  
This model must balance **stability, revenue, and social good** while ensuring long-term sustainability.

## **🔹 Pilot Model: Letter to Tyronda**  

### **🏡 The Proposal**  
Tyronda, you will **manage 1135 and 203** and act as a **gatekeeper** for tenants.  
- You and your daughter will arrange the rooms at **1135**.  
- Your other daughter moves into **203** with the kids (or remains nearby).  

### **🏡 Space & Social Structure**  
Each house operates under the following structure:  
- **Bedrooms** → Private, long-term tenant housing.  
- **Dining Room** → Public, house-wide use with community standards.  
- **Living Room** → Scheduled use, rules-based environment, daycare integration.  

The goal is to **center the structure around families, particularly mothers with children.**

## **🔄 Long-Term Plan (14-Year Cycle)**  
1. **Phase 1: 1135 as the Entry Point**  
   - Residents start at 1135 with **clear expectations** and an **evaluation process**.  

2. **Phase 2: Transition to Mifflin (203)**  
   - When ready, tenants move to **203**.  
   - **Two residents on deck at all times** to prepare for transition to permanent housing.  

3. **Phase 3: Permanent Placement & Expansion**  
   - **Selection based on long-term viability**—the most stable tenants stay.  
   - **Clear rules on tenant behavior & expectations.**  
   - Gradual expansion into other properties (1118, 401, Hickory, Prospect).

## **💰 Financial Structure**  

- **Base Rent:** $650 per room = $1,950 for a 3-bedroom house.  
- **Utilities:** $500 pledged, remainder covered by manager (Tyronda).  
- **Manager’s Income:** Anything charged above $650 is **profit.**  
- **Flexibility:** Over time, the model will adjust to **balance costs, growth, and tenant contributions.**

## **🏡 Long-Term Vision: Housing + Daycare Model**  
Every house will serve **three purposes**:  
4. **Home for long-term tenants**  
5. **Daycare operations (run by a teacher/tenant or external provider)**  
6. **Basement space for additional utility or business use**  
(the basement has future use to be detailed at a later date)

**Tenants must adapt to living around children**—either as parents or as part of a **kid-friendly environment.**  
- **Strict control over tenant behavior** → No drugs, poor language, inappropriate conduct.  
- **Reputation management is critical** → Years of instability have damaged trust; this must be repaired.  

Each house will **serve 6 children, not all from the house.**  
- **Parents pay the teacher directly.**  
- **Teacher is either a tenant or an external provider.**  
- **Tenant selection must align with the daycare model.**

## **📈 Growth Timeline**  

### **Phase 1: Immediate Setup**  
- Tyronda manages **three rooms** to rent at 1135 & 203.  
- Initial tenants must be **fully vetted.**
	- We need to come up with a system
- pay for 3 rooms, rent three rooms. 


### **Phase 2: Expansion (April - Next Properties Online)**  
- Three new rooms will be available at **1118 or 401**.  
	- three rooms each
- After that, **Hickory (1223) will open**.  
	- three rooms and a fourth room that will be mine
- Then, **Prospect (815) becomes available**.  
	- This will have up to 5 rooms, but they need to move out reliably for a different project

**Tyronda will eventually co-manage two other properties**, transitioning full control once the current managers exit.  

- need to visit 424 and 435

## **🔹 Revenue Model: Testing the Market**  
- **Premium Rents:** Manager profit comes from premium rent on **long-term tenants**.  
- **Target Stability:** We are **not encouraging short-term stays**—the focus is on **multi-year tenants.**  
- **Pricing Strategy:**  
  - If rent is above market average, **tenant experience must justify the cost.**  
  - **Airbnb Model:** A room at $43/night = **$1,290/month.**  
  - **Full house Airbnb operation would require total control of 1135 & 203.**  
  - **April to June:** Use the transition period to stabilize and repair properties.  
  - Once another house opens up - you will move people out of 203 and introduce new people. Goal is to charge a large amount upfront and decrease the costs going forward.

## **🔹 Next Steps**  
📌 **Define clear tenant criteria—who is allowed in, what are the deal breakers?**  
📌 **Develop a structured tenant onboarding process.**  
📌 **Establish rules for daycare & household operations.**  
📌 **Set up financial tracking—measure profitability and tenant retention.**

# tenant criteria - 

I need to create a tenant workflow

I need a set of steps to go through to qualify someone
I need to determine how we are going to advertise and how we are going to pay for it


What are the requirements to qualify at first
what are the requirements to move on to the other houses
