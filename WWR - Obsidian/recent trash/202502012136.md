## 🔹 Financial Requirements for Tenants  
- **Deposit + Last Month’s Rent = $2,000 upfront.**

## **🏡 Tenant Risk Assessment (Ranking System)**  
Tenants will be ranked based on their **likelihood of problems.**  
Each factor will be weighted to determine **risk level before approval.**  

### **🔹 Key Risk Factors (High to Low)**  
1️⃣ **Ability to pay full move-in amount ($2,000 deposit + first month rent)**  
2️⃣ **Stable income & job security**  
3️⃣ **No pets (reduces liability & damage risk)**  
4️⃣ **No children (lowers complexity of eviction & housing logistics)**  
5️⃣ **Strong work history (demonstrates responsibility & stability)**  
6️⃣ **Clean bank history (no overdrafts, evidence of financial stability)**  
7️⃣ **Background check (no major legal issues, history of rental fraud, etc.)**  
8️⃣ **No recent judgments or unpaid debts (ensures ability to pay rent consistently)**  

📌 **Tenants with lower risk scores will be prioritized for placement.**

## **🔹 Next Steps**  
📌 **Establish an official ranking system for risk assessment.**  
📌 **Define the threshold for rejecting a tenant based on risk factors.**  
📌 **Set up an escrow management system to track deposits and liabilities.**
