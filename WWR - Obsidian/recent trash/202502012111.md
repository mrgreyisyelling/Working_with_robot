## 🔹 Core Issue  
I don’t **want** to sell the real estate, but I feel like I **have to.**  
The question is: **What is actually driving this decision?**  

## 🔹 Possible Motivations  
- **Guilt** → Am I selling because I feel obligated to?  
- **Capacity** → Do I truly lack the ability to maintain these properties?  
- **Strategy** → Is selling the best long-term move, or just the easiest?  
- **Vision** → If I keep them, what is the plan that makes it work?  

---

## 🔹 Alternative Vision: A Structured Social Network  
I believe the best way to fill these houses is by **developing a healthy, well-run social network** that **gates access** strategically, ensuring we attract the right **long-term tenants.**  
The plan must **balance stability and selectivity** while ensuring the community sustains itself.

## **🏡 Letter to Tyronda - Defining a Pilot Model**  

### **🏠 The Proposal**  
Tyronda, I want you to take **1135** and act as **gatekeeper.**  
You and your daughter arrange the rooms as you see fit.  

- Your other daughter moves into **203** with the kids (or remains nearby).  
- **Both locations** operate under the same structured approach:  

### **🏡 Space & Social Structure**  
Each house is divided into **functional zones**:  
- **Bedrooms** → Private  
- **Dining Room** → Public to the house, standard rules apply  
- **Living Room** → Scheduled use, structured rules  

The living rooms will be **designed for babies and daycare.**  
We want to **center the structure around families,** starting with mothers with children.  

---

## **🔄 Long-Term Plan (14-Year Cycle)**  
1. **Phase 1: Tyronda's House (1135) → First Entry Point**  
   - The first wave of residents are **mothers with children.**  
   - We create a clear **evaluation process** from the beginning.  

2. **Phase 2: Mifflin → Next Step Housing**  
   - People move from **1135 to Mifflin** when ready.  
   - Mifflin always has **two residents on deck** preparing for long-term housing.  

3. **Phase 3: Permanent Placement**  
   - We **choose the strongest candidates** to stay long-term.  
   - If behavior does not improve, residents are asked to leave.  
   - Expectations, time limits, and evaluation criteria are clear from the start.  

---

## 🔹 Next Step  
📌 **Define the criteria for entry, transition, and evaluation.**  
📌 **Clarify the financial model—does this sustain itself better than selling?**  
📌 **Identify risks and how to mitigate them.**

# Tyronda will define criteria
# Financials:

house is $650 a room - this is 1950 for a three bedroom. $500 is pledged for the utilities with the remainder on you the manager. The rest of the pay is rent.
Anything you charge about $650 to the indivdiual tenant, is yours. This will be modulated over time to share costs and distribute growth. 
We are aiming to turn all the houses you will manage into:

- home
- daycare
- basement

The tenants living there need to be taught how to live comfortably around children. Either because they are living there or there will be a daycare being run there.
The houses have to be or become highly regulated around the use of drugs, poor language, informal dressing and behavior, etc., we need to standardize the product, without making it awful. Each daycare is going to be run by a teacher that is going to be fully responsible for everything involving the kids. The rules and the expectations put on them is significant, and it has to be controlled.
Therefore, these homes, for our multible purpose has to be not be overly connected to anything that smells like 'bad for kids'
If it does happen - control it, and force it to walk the line so we can control it. Take it away from the houses if you can't control it. 
Reputation matters, and we have a wrecked one from years of letting nuts in. If  this is done long term, you need to manage neighbor relationships

The houses will each server 6 children - not all from the house.
The parents will provide payment to the teacher, and the teacher will either be a tenant or come to the house to run their business
This is a long process but we are doing it and you are partially responsible for it because of the arrangement.

Initially - you will have three rooms to your name, and 3 to rent.
2 at 1135
1 at 203

start with one at 1135 - after 203 is ready and setup, filter from 1135 to 203
at 1135 charge full rent - do not think about stuff, The price that will be maximum for the rooms.
hold at 203 until room comes available. Charge less then Full rent at that address, so anything else you suggest will be cheaper.

After 203 - by april we will have three new rooms, either at 1118 or at 401 or both.
after those - 1223 hickory will open up
and then finally 815 prospect.

There are two more properties you are going to co-manage with the current managers, but they will give up control when they leave.

So your income will come from the premium you charge on the rooms. We are not going to encourage short term stays. We are looking for tenants that will last multiple years. So if you charge above average, its going to be your responsibility to improve things to make it worth it and allows us to attract customers who will be willing and able, practically speaking, to last towards 2+ years.
The total transition into day care is going to take 7 years. At 7 year mark we need every room and every house running smoothly. 

Three rooms to rent, makes your working rent at least a $650 premium on each room, to break even.
That seems impossible - but we want to see and start to measure what we can get at different levels. 
What would be necessary to get double the value per night?
$43 a night are Airbnb numbers - so you will need to have both houses under control before you can do that. If we are delaying on 203 until april, and 1135 is going to be all your people. 
Lets use the inbetween period to do basic repairs and get the relatiosnhip to the basement worked out.
