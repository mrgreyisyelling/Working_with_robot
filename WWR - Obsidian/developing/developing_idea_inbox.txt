# 📌 Why Am I Selling the Real Estate?  

## 🔹 Core Issue  
I don’t **want** to sell the real estate, but I feel like I **have to.**  
The question is: **What is actually driving this decision?**  

## 🔹 Possible Motivations  
- **Guilt** → Am I selling because I feel obligated to?  
- **Capacity** → Do I truly lack the ability to maintain these properties?  
- **Strategy** → Is selling the best long-term move, or just the easiest?  
- **Vision** → If I keep them, what is the plan that makes it work?

## **🏠 Alternative Vision: A Structured Housing Network**  
I believe the best way to fill these houses is by **developing a strong, well-run social network** that **gates access strategically** to attract the right long-term tenants.  
This model must balance **stability, revenue, and social good** while ensuring long-term sustainability.

## **🔹 Pilot Model: Letter to Tyronda**  

### **🏡 The Proposal**  
Tyronda, you will **manage 1135 and 203** and act as a **gatekeeper** for tenants.  
- You and your daughter will arrange the rooms at **1135**.  
- Your other daughter moves into **203** with the kids (or remains nearby).  

### **🏡 Space & Social Structure**  
Each house operates under the following structure:  
- **Bedrooms** → Private, long-term tenant housing.  
- **Dining Room** → Public, house-wide use with community standards.  
- **Living Room** → Scheduled use, rules-based environment, daycare integration.  

The goal is to **center the structure around families, particularly mothers with children.**

## **🔄 Long-Term Plan (14-Year Cycle)**  
1. **Phase 1: 1135 as the Entry Point**  
   - Residents start at 1135 with **clear expectations** and an **evaluation process**.  

2. **Phase 2: Transition to Mifflin (203)**  
   - When ready, tenants move to **203**.  
   - **Two residents on deck at all times** to prepare for transition to permanent housing.  

3. **Phase 3: Permanent Placement & Expansion**  
   - **Selection based on long-term viability**—the most stable tenants stay.  
   - **Clear rules on tenant behavior & expectations.**  
   - Gradual expansion into other properties (1118, 401, Hickory, Prospect).

## **💰 Financial Structure**  

- **Base Rent:** $650 per room = $1,950 for a 3-bedroom house.  
- **Utilities:** $500 pledged, remainder covered by manager (Tyronda).  
- **Manager’s Income:** Anything charged above $650 is **profit.**  
- **Flexibility:** Over time, the model will adjust to **balance costs, growth, and tenant contributions.**

## **🏡 Long-Term Vision: Housing + Daycare Model**  
Every house will serve **three purposes**:  
1. **Home for long-term tenants**  
2. **Daycare operations (run by a teacher/tenant or external provider)**  
3. **Basement space for additional utility or business use**  

**Tenants must adapt to living around children**—either as parents or as part of a **kid-friendly environment.**  
- **Strict control over tenant behavior** → No drugs, poor language, inappropriate conduct.  
- **Reputation management is critical** → Years of instability have damaged trust; this must be repaired.  

Each house will **serve 6 children, not all from the house.**  
- **Parents pay the teacher directly.**  
- **Teacher is either a tenant or an external provider.**  
- **Tenant selection must align with the daycare model.**

## **📈 Growth Timeline**  

### **Phase 1: Immediate Setup**  
- Tyronda manages **three rooms** to rent at 1135 & 203.  
- Initial tenants must be **fully vetted.**  
- Full rent charged at **1135**, reduced rent at **203**.  

### **Phase 2: Expansion (April - Next Properties Online)**  
- Three new rooms will be available at **1118 or 401**.  
- After that, **Hickory (1223) will open**.  
- Then, **Prospect (815) becomes available**.  

**Tyronda will eventually co-manage two other properties**, transitioning full control once the current managers exit.

## **🔹 Revenue Model: Testing the Market**  
- **Premium Rents:** Manager profit comes from premium rent on **long-term tenants**.  
- **Target Stability:** We are **not encouraging short-term stays**—the focus is on **multi-year tenants.**  
- **Pricing Strategy:**  
  - If rent is above market average, **tenant experience must justify the cost.**  
  - **Airbnb Model:** A room at $43/night = **$1,290/month.**  
  - **Full house Airbnb operation would require total control of 1135 & 203.**  
  - **April to June:** Use the transition period to stabilize and repair properties.

## **🔹 Next Steps**  
📌 **Define clear tenant criteria—who is allowed in, what are the deal breakers?**  
📌 **Develop a structured tenant onboarding process.**  
📌 **Establish rules for daycare & household operations.**  
📌 **Set up financial tracking—measure profitability and tenant retention.**
