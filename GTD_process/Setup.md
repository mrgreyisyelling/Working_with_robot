### **📌 Organizing Our Workflow: How We Manage Tasks & Projects**  

We have structured our **task management system** using a combination of **GTimeLog and categorized task files** to ensure clarity, focus, and progress tracking.

---

### **1️⃣ Tracking Work with GTimeLog**  
- **GTimeLog is used for real-time logging of completed actions.**  
- Every meaningful action gets recorded with a **timestamp** and **project prefix** (e.g., `Meta: - Updating task list`).  

---

### **2️⃣ Task & Project Organization**  

| **File**            | **Purpose** | **What Goes Here?** |
|---------------------|------------|----------------------|
| `tasks.txt`        | 🔥 **Next Actions** | Only **immediate, focused tasks** that need to be worked on now. |
| `project.txt`      | 🚀 **Active Projects** | Tasks that are **part of a project but not immediate**. |
| `maybe.txt`        | 🕒 **Someday/Maybe** | Ideas, deferred tasks, and non-urgent items to revisit later. |

---

### **3️⃣ Formatting Rules for Consistency**  
✅ **Each task is timestamped** (Date Added: `[YYYY-MM-DD]`).  
✅ **Each task is prefixed by a project/category** (e.g., `AIReconstruction:`).  
✅ **Projects are not yet clearly defined**—this will need further refinement.  

---

### **Next Step:**  
📌 **We need to define clear project categories** so everything is grouped logically.  
📌 **Should we break projects into structured sections or keep them fluid for now?**  

🚀 Let’s refine this and lock in the structure!
